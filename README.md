# TDclick git project.

basic git work flow,
when you would like to : fix an issue, add a new feature, ect create a branch off dev for it.
work on the issue/feature on your branch, make sure to pull often so you don't run in to merge conflicts when making your pull request.
once the feature/bug is fixed or done make a pull(if the team is large enough someone will review your pull request before merging it back in to dev)
seeing as our team is fairly small often you will be responcable for reviewing your own merge please still use pull reuests as it leaves a history to revert to if needed to. with esaly view able coments.


cavoits 1. Only ever pull request from dev back to stable build when you have a stable(buildable runable version).
        2. Only merge to master with non code realted things that will not mess up the down stream suhc as README, git ignore, ect
